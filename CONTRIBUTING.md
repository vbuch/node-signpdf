# Contributing

* All PRs are welcome in the `develop` branch.
* Please, stick to the repo's defined [Purpose](README.md#purpose) and try to write your code as readable as possible.
* We do code reviews and may ask you to change things before we merge code.
* This is a git-flow repo. We use the default git flow with a `v` version prefix. You shouldn't care much while writeing a feature but good to know.
* Note that [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) is used in the commit messages. That's not a must but we think it's nice.
